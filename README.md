# Stealay

This is our game jam submission for [KluJam 2025 Tech Edition](https://itch.io/jam/klagenfurt-game-jam-tech-edition)!

You're on a mission - break into the museum, evade the guards, steal the precious gem. Every heist needs a solid plan and it's up to you to account for all eventualities and then watch your thief put it into practice, one step at a time. This disparity isn't a delay. It's a Stealay!

All assets (including art, sounds, music and code) are made by our team.

You can try our game out on [Itch.io](https://q1studios.itch.io/stealay) or watch our trailer on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-degcQKY_KU)!
